# Frontend-landingpage
Tis Page is a responsive landing project for Dash, a fictional driver service. It features HTML5 and CSS3 for device-friendly layouts, intuitive design with a prominent sign-up form, custom fonts, scalable SVG graphics, and modern CSS techniques for usability.



Key Points and Features of the Project:
Responsive Design: The landing page adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries. This ensures a consistent user experience on different devices.

Semantic HTML: Proper use of HTML5 tags (<main>, <header>, <footer>) for better structure and accessibility.

CSS Flexbox: Utilization of Flexbox for layout (display: flex) ensures easy alignment and distribution of elements within sections (main, footer).

Styling and Theming: CSS is used for styling, including custom fonts (Montserrat from Google Fonts), colors, and spacing (padding, margin). This enhances visual appeal and readability.

Form Handling: Includes a form (<form>) with various input types (text, email, checkbox) and validation (required attribute), enhancing user interaction and data collection.

Interactive Elements: Hover effects (:hover) on buttons (input[type="submit"]) provide visual feedback, enhancing usability.

Images and Icons: Use of SVG images (scooter.svg, social media icons) for scalable graphics and better performance.

Accessibility: Links (<a>) styled with colors and hover states for better accessibility and user experience.

Version Control: Linked CSS file (style.css) and external font resources are managed using relative paths and external links, ensuring clean and organized project structure.
